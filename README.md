## My process

I first 'blocked'out' the design using divs with different coloured borders.

I then 'filled in' each div with the content before removing the borders.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This challenge taught me about positioning and styling using Flexbox. To keep track of the different flex containers I applied coloured borders to each div. This helped me when assemblinng the structure of the project and when defining the flex properties. 


### Continued development
Here are some developments I would like to make:
- Make a functional counter using javascript
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Useful resources

- [Flexbox froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/) - This helped me learn Flexbox positioning. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Flexbox Mozilla artical.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Aligning_Items_in_a_Flex_Container) - this is a very useful artical about flex containers.
